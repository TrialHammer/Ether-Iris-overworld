# Ether-Iris-overworld

This is the [Iris](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/iris-world-gen-the-dimension-engine.84586/) Overworld pack used for TRIALHAMMER Ã— RIA Ether server.

## Ether

The Ether server is under a collab activity (*Codename Expeditor #2*) between two server communities: TRIALHAMMER and RIA.

This server is designed to be a short-term server where players can harvest resources from 1.21.4 and take them back to the main long-running servers respectively.

## Author's Notes

I personally do not recommend you to use this pack in your server because this is developed to suit a very specific need. Most of the changes are not considered "good" in a general sense if you plan to make a long-term server, especially for the Ancient City. I suggest you to wait for Iris' official support if you want them to properly generate.

However, if you are interested, some major changes from the default pack are:
* Forced Ancient City to generate around the world.
  * The Ancient City as of this time is still flawed. 
  * They are generated on the surface. *Who says Wardens don't need some Vitamin Ds?*
  * ~~You generally won't be happy to see it unless you're me.~~ 
* Altered the spawn rate for Trail Ruins and Trial Chambers.
  * Players can visit these places more often during the period to get resources exclusive to them.
* Added a custom loot table to generate Pottery Sherds around the world.
  * This includes fixing the loot table errors in the default pack.
  * Almost all chests / barrels around the world have some chance to generate sherds.

If you do want to use it, the simplest way is to download this pack and replace it with the default overworld pack.

*Below is the original README.md from upstream. Huge thanks to Iris developers for their help during me doing this insane project.*
